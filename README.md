# Data refers to collections of digitally stored units in other words,stuff that is kept on a computing device.
STRUCTURED DATA
-Data that has been formatted to a set structure
-Each  data unit fits nicely into a table in a database
-Its ready for analysis eg Firstname,lastname and cellno
UNSTRUCTURED DATA
-Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used
-Further work is required to enable analysis eg email consent and social media posts
SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA
-Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed
QUANTITATIVE (Numerical)                       QUALITATIVE(Categorical)
.Uses numbers                                  .Non-numerical/descriptive
CONTINUOUS(Measurable)                          NOMINAL(Non-ordered)
.Weight,temperature                             .Ethnicity,haircolor
DESCRETE(Countable)                             ORINAL(Orderly)                     
.Number of FB likes,final score in football     .Class grades,date range,opinions

.Data governance plays a central role when aspiring for data quality
# DEFINING BIG DATA
Big data is structured and unstructured data is so massive and complex in scale,that its difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques
5 Vs for defining and characterizing big data
.Volume the sheer scale of data being produced is unprecendented and requires new tools,skiils and processes
.Variety there are already a lot of legacy file format such as CSV and MP3 and with new innovations, new formats and merging all the time.
.Velocity
.Variability the fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable
.Veracity the quality including accuracy and truthfulness
